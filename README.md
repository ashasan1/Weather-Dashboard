# Week 6- Weather Dashboard

I created a web application that gives the user the weather of any City.

I used a API from OpenWeather to get the temperature, humidity, wind speed, uv index and 5 day forecast.

When the user searches a city, their search is saved into their Search History. 

When a user searches a city, then they are presented with the weather data from the current day, and 5 days forward.
